- Create a Hover effect for the **Portfolio ** sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background. This should be achieved using jQuery.
- Tell the user through a pop up that you have received their message and also thank them for contacting you . For example: ** johndoe we have received your message. Thank you fro reaching out to us. **
